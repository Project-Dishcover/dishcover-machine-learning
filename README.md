This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`ModelBahan.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of building a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras with the InceptionV3 method to complete image analysis and object detection for each class, to optimize the training using the EarlyStopping Callback, producing an output image of 150x150 32 batches of 15 classes.
